# InstaCartPython
Data analysis and customer profiling in Python for an online grocery store "InstaCart". The goal of the analysis is to derive insights and suggest strategies for better customer segmentation - focusing on puchasing behaviour of the customers.

## Key questions:
1. What are the busiest days of the week and periods of the day?
2. When are the most expensive orders being placed?
3. What types of products are being bought? Which departments have the highest frequency of orders?
4. What customer profiles and patterns are detectable?
